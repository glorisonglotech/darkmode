I've created a simple project that covers the basics of the JavaScript DOM.
Feel free to clone it and learn how to implement dark mode using the JavaScript Document Object Model.

## Features

- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Save user preference in local storage
- Responsive design

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dev-glory0/darkmode.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dark-mode-project
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the project in action.

## Usage

- Click the toggle button to switch between light and dark mode.
- The selected mode will be saved and applied on your next visit.
